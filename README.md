# FYP-Fast-Flux-Detection

This is the code for my Final year project research titled: Fast Flux Attack Engine for Benchmarking AI Based DNS Security System. This is a basic simulation of how LSTM model detects a DNS query to be a fast flux or not based on a few relevant features.

How to run:
1. Download all files
2. Make sure to provide a few dataset, benign and fast flux, for testing the performance
3. Install all libraries needed, including streamlit for running the app
4. In terminal (VSCode terminal can be used), type streamlit run app.py. It should run locally
5. In the app, upload one of the dataset that consists of DNS dig queries. The model should run and show whether the queries have fast flux domain or not

Good Luck
